Invoker, in web service context, simply means to
invoke a method of the service, and the Invoker component does exactly the same.
So what is special about the Invoker component? Well, it provides you with the
ability to customize your service method execution. It provides you with the ability
to control the service invocation. It effectively means you can prefix or add more
functionality to your service business method before the method is actually invoked.
Invokers are applied to a service endpoint.

Invoker acts more like simple filter components. It gives you the ability to intercept
the message before the service method is called or invoked. Invokers though cannot
be called as interceptors. In CXF, interceptors process messages at different phases
in an inbound or outbound chain. Invokers do not have phases, they merely invoke
a service method with the ability to intercept the message just before the service
method is invoked.
